NOTE: An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process successfully through PAR.

This mapped NCD file can be used to evaluate how the design&apos;s logic has been mapped into FPGA logic resources.  It can also be used to analyze preliminary, logic-level (pre-route) timing with one of the Xilinx static timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing Analyzer).
