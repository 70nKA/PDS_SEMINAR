INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator
   line_buffer_logic_mod/Mmux_o_pixel_data1171 failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer sobel_mod/Madd__sub0004_xor<7>11_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "SLICEM" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:18 - The design is too large for the given device and package. 
   Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device.

   NOTE: An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

   This mapped NCD file can be used to evaluate how the design's logic has been
   mapped into FPGA logic resources.  It can also be used to analyze
   preliminary, logic-level (pre-route) timing with one of the Xilinx static
   timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing Analyzer).

Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      2
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           400 out of   9,312    4%
  Number of SLICEMs:                3,464 out of   2,328  148% (OVERMAPPED)
  (SLICEMs can only be placed in SLICEM sites.)
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             8,553 out of   9,312   91%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          4,439 out of   4,656   95%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   4,439 out of   4,439 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   4,439   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       8,739 out of   9,312   93%
    Number used as logic:             2,394
    Number used as a route-thru:        186
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:   6,144
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      15

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                  8 out of     232    3%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      8 out of      20   40%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of      24   12%
  Number of MULT18X18SIOs:                2 out of      20   10%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                6.72

Peak Memory Usage:  734 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  17 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   16 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
